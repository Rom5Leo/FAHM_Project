# Decision Log — FAHM (self-built pipeline)

## D00 — Architecture: notebook / src / config separation
- Choice: notebooks hold no logic (calls + displays only); all transforms
  live in src/fahm; all paths and parameters live in configs/config.yaml.
- Reason: reproducibility, testability, and one place to change experiments.
- Consequence: every notebook cell >~5 lines is a signal to move code to src.

## D01 — Path resolution anchored at the project root
- Problem: notebooks run with CWD = notebooks/, so root-relative paths in
  the config failed (FileNotFoundError).
- Alternatives: (a) ../-style paths relative to the notebook — rejected,
  breaks for any script not launched from notebooks/; (b) always launch
  from repo root — fragile, relies on discipline.
- Choice: load_config() resolves every cfg["paths"] entry to absolute,
  using the config file's own location (configs/ = root + 1) as the anchor.
- Consequence: load_config is the single place the config is opened; no
  other code ever handles relative paths.

## D02 — Naive load first, typed load second
- Choice: step-1 load_raw() is a plain pd.read_csv with no dtypes/parsing.
- Reason: establishes a measured baseline (memory, dtypes) so step 2's
  typing decisions are improvements against a number, not guesses.
- Consequence: known ugliness left visible on purpose: Unnamed: 0 index
  column, timestamp as object/string, float64 everywhere.

## D03 — Package named `fahm`
- Choice: src/fahm (short, meaningful) over src/modules (meaningless) or
  src/fahm_project (long). Import name = package name convention.

# Lessons

## L01 
- IPython magics take no trailing comments
- autoreload refreshes code but not variables already in memory (re-run cells that created data after editing functions)
- "Python 3.11" in VSC's picker can be several different environments.
